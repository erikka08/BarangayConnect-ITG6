    <p>BarangayConnect – Terms &amp; Conditions</p>

    <h3>1) Eligibility &amp; Accounts</h3>
    <p>To use BarangayConnect, residents must create an account using accurate and truthful personal information, including their full name, active mobile number, and optional email address. These details are needed so barangay administrators can properly verify each resident’s identity before granting full access. While your account is still under review, you will only have limited access, specifically access to view emergency hotlines only. Full access will be given once authorized barangay staff approve your account. Residents are responsible for keeping their login credentials private and must ensure that no one else uses their account without permission. Any activity that takes place under your account will be considered your responsibility. Only one account per resident is allowed, and the barangay may deny or remove accounts with false, duplicated, or misleading information.</p>

    <h3 id="privacy">2) Data &amp; Privacy</h3>
    <p>BarangayConnect collects only the necessary information required to provide barangay-related services. This mainly includes your contact details and the information you submit through forms, requests, or reports. Your mobile number and email will be used only for sending important service-related updates and clarifications. You should not upload personal IDs or sensitive documents unless specifically requested by authorized barangay personnel for verification. All submissions are processed through barangay-managed systems where authorized staff review and act on your concerns. Reasonable measures are applied to protect your data, but users must also handle their information responsibly.</p>

    <h3>3) Acceptable Use</h3>
    <p>BarangayConnect must only be used for legitimate barangay concerns such as filing service requests, reporting incidents, or following up on barangay matters. Users must not submit false, abusive, defamatory, inappropriate, or malicious content. Uploading materials that violate laws, harm other users, or contain harmful code is strictly prohibited. Respect for others’ privacy is required. Share only information that is necessary and relevant to the barangay concern you are filing.</p>

    <h3>4) Requests, Reports, and Supporting Details</h3>
    <p>Barangay requests and incident reports may require additional information or clarification. Processing time may vary depending on the type of concern and the workload of barangay personnel. Status indicators such as “pending,” “in progress,” or “resolved” are for information purposes and may change after review. Barangay staff may contact you if more details are needed before taking action. It is your responsibility to provide clear and accurate descriptions and attach only the necessary photos or documents to support your concern.</p>

    <h3>5) Notifications &amp; Communication</h3>
    <p>By using BarangayConnect, you agree to receive service-related notices through the contact details you provided. These include status updates, reminders, and requests for clarification. In addition to SMS or email, updates and notifications can also be viewed directly on your personal dashboard inside the BarangayConnect system. Ensure your contact information remains accurate to avoid missing important updates, and respond to barangay messages promptly to help speed up request processing.</p>

    <h3>6) Security</h3>
    <p>If you suspect that someone is misusing your account, report it immediately to barangay personnel. While the barangay applies security measures to safeguard your account, complete protection cannot be guaranteed. Do not share your password with anyone. Always log out when using shared devices and avoid accessing the system through unsecured networks, especially when handling sensitive details.</p>

    <h3>7) Availability &amp; Changes</h3>
    <p>BarangayConnect services may become temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, system updates, or unforeseen technical problems. The barangay aims to restore access as quickly as possible, but certain issues may be beyond its control. Features and terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the platform means you accept the latest version of these Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

    <h3>8) Limitation</h3>
    <p>BarangayConnect acts as a digital platform to submit barangay-related concerns, but final outcomes still depend on official review, verification, and field processes. The barangay is not responsible for delays caused by technical issues, incomplete information from users, emergencies, or conditions outside reasonable control.</p>

    <h3>9) Contact Information</h3>
    <p>For concerns or questions, residents may visit the BarangayConnect office at Barangay Tambo, Parañaque City, or contact the barangay during office hours (Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM–5:00 PM).</p>
